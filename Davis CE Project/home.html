        <h2>An Unknown Defender</h2>
        <p>
            While a decent number of the first 10 amendments to the United States' Constitution are quite loud in their
            presence in the media, there are just as many rights given to us that go wholly unnoticed despite playing
            such a large role in our lives. It is likely that, despite our previous education on the subject, very few
            would be able to explain the Fourth Amendment's purpose. However, the benefit of the Fourth Amendment should
            not be understated, and this lack of knowledge does not do the amendment proper justice.
        </p>

        <h2>What Exactly Is It</h2>
        <p>
            The Fourth Amendment officially enforces that each person has a right
        </p>
        <blockquote cite="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-4/">
            <p>
                “…to be secure in their persons,
                houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no
                Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly
                describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized
                ("United States Constitution Amend. IV.").”
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            In simpler terms, this amendment states that the government and law enforcement are prohibited from
            searching or taking any items believed to be a part of a criminal case unless they have a warrant given to
            them by a court in response to probable cause by the person trying to obtain a warrant. Essentially, the
            government is unable to abuse its power in searching and seizing in order to inflict control over the people
            of the United States. This applies whether the search or seizure be about an item on a person's body, in
            their house, on a document they own, or any other possession.
        </p>
        <div>
            <h3>Functional Specifics</h3>
            <p>
                There is an importance in understanding the language used in the amendment's definition, however as it
                has
                been a point of contention throughout the past century. For instance, in the 1947 Supreme Court case of
                <cite>Harris v. United States</cite>, the Justices' interpretation of the amendment judged that the
                amendment's "unreasonable searches and seizures" statement was in relation to simply having any search
                occur
                given probable cause, with or without warrant. However, only a year later, in the case of
                <cite>Trupiano v. United States</cite>, the court changed their interpretation to instead be that a
                search
                must obtain a search warrant whenever reasonable. This decision was then reverted back to follow the
                1947
                interpretation only 2 years later in the 1950 case of <cite>United States v. Rabinowitz</cite>. This
                turbulence calmed down quite a bit in the following decades, but the court would occasionally change
                their
                minds about which interpretation to apply.<br>
                As of now, following some indecisiveness in the 1990s, the main interpretation of the amendment is that
                searches can be conducted without warrant given that the search was based on suspicion that warranted a
                warrantless search, was executed in a reasonable manner, and that the case is not one of a criminal
                nature
                ("Fourth Amendment Search and Seizure" Amdt4.2.1).
            </p>
            <h2>The Development of the Amendment</h2>
            <p>
                To be one of the ten rights initially guaranteed by the United States' Constitution, the history of the
                amendment must be rooted in the experience of the colonists and their histories. The Fourth Amendment is
                no
                exception to this idea, with its creation being somewhat a more official and wordy derivation of the
                English
                saying, “Every man's house is his castle.” There were multiple cases that pushed this idea forward in
                pre-American history, such as Semayne's Case, in which the reporter, Sir Edward Coke, put the saying
                into
                official doctrine by writing
                <q cite="http://www.commonlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1572/333.pdf">
                    the house of every one is to him as his castle and fortress.
                </q> (The Court of King's Bench 195).
            </p>
            <p>
                Another case, the 1705 English case of Entick v. Carrington, was cited by the United States Supreme
                Court in
                the 1886 case of Boyd v. United States as being a case that
                <q cite="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/116/616/#F4">
                    …may be confidently asserted that its propositions were in the minds of those who framed the Fourth
                    Amendment to the Constitution…
                </q> (115-116).
                Entick's case came about due to his associate, John Wilkes, being a producer of politically critical
                pamphlets which led to a forcible raid and search of Entick's property. Given the political turmoil
                present
                in the colonial life, it should be no surprise that this case became so engrained into the viewpoints of
                the
                colonists. It was such that, when James Madison penned the Bill of Rights so as to have it amended into
                the
                Constitution, the wording of his initial version remained almost wholly unchanged when being adopted
                (“S.
                Doc. 112-9” 1199-1201).

        <h2>In Short</h2>
        <p>
            Essentially, the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution is one which is built on a history of
            unrest throughout English and colonial existence. Despite being an easily confusing doctrine, it is a very
            necessary one to protect the privacy and freedom of the people. While it is not nearly as high-sung as other
            amendments, there is a long and important history to the Fourth Amendment.
